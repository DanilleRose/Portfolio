    <h3>Bio</h3>
  
    
    <p> I am a current highschool student (almost 16)and engaged 
     in a summer program for girls which introduces girls the to the basics of computer science and allows them to interact and
     create a sister hood together.I am in Brooklyn and am known as a city kid so this program widens my horizons.
     This is just an intro to my interests and what I've done so far.<p>
